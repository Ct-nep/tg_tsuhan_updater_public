# this is an util that will generate a pseudo-DPOP

# But the way they screwed up makes it much easier for us.
# We can just generate random ECC keys and sign any data and as long as
# the keys match and signature is valid, then mercari doesn't care if
# it's a new key.
# So let's make a new key everytime so they dont blacklist any JWK
# public keys or something dumb
# Just make sure the method & url match the endpoint you're trying to
# call uuid SHOULD probably be a real uuid, but it doesn't seem like
# they're even checking this for much.
# Maybe some tracking for later, so making it purely random just like
# the key will make it really hard for mercari to detect this as
# inorganic traffic if spread across IPs
# The biggest giveaway MAY be multiple keys/uuid being used for 1 IP.
# But then you just swap it every week or so instead and problem solved
